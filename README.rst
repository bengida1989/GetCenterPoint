GetCenterPoint
==============
A Pointwise Glyph script which enables the user to create a db point at the center point location of a circular curve segment.

Usage
~~~~~
The user must invoke the script to begin the selection process. Once invoked, the user will then be prompted to "Select a Circular Connector and/or DB Curve". The user can select either circular connectors, DB curves, or any combination thereof. Multiple entities can be selected.

When the circular segment(s) are chosen, the user will select the "Done" button, and at this point the script will simultaneously render the center point for each selected segment in red and then terminate.

If the user doesn't select a circular segment, there is no error printed and the script will terminate as normal without rendering a center point.
